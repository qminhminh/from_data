/// Flutter library for generating dynamic forms driven by schema data.
///
/// This library provides a schema-driven approach to form creation, allowing
/// you to define complex forms using JSON or Dart maps and automatically
/// generate fully functional UI with validation, defaults, and extensibility.
///
/// See the [README](https://github.com/qminhminh/from_data) for more details.
